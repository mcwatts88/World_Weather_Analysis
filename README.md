# World Weather Analysis

## Project Details

This project was set up to use API calls to generate maps based off of customer preferences for potential vacation locations. Two thousand coordinate pairs were generated and matched to cities using the CitiPy module. Using the openweathermap API the current weather was acquired for each city. The cities were matched to locations on a map using the google maps API. The closest hotel was found for each city and assigned to a marker. The markers were plotted and have the hotel, city, country and current weather when you click on them. A route map was generated for 4 cities chosen in close proximity to simulate a possible driving trip a customer could take.
